# {{ page.title }}

A key concept advocated by Peel is the ability to share hand-crafted configurations for a set of systems on a particular host environment.
The suggested way to do so is through a dedicated Git repository. 

Please refer [to the "Sharing Configurations" section of the Manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/environment-configurations.html#sharing-configurations) for concrete instructions regarding the use of shared environment configurations.

Below you can find a list of environment configurations available online. 
Please contact us if you wish to add your environment configuration to the list.
