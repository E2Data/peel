Experiments are defined in Peel using a Spring [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) container. The set of beans required to define an experiment represent the system experiments domain introduced in the [Motivation]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/motivation.html) section.

## Domain Model

The domain model adopted by Peel reflects the basic experiment structure outlined above. A somewhat simplified UML diagram can be seen below.

### Experiment

The central class in this model is *Experiment*. It specifies the experiment *name*, the *command* that executes the experiment application, the number of experiment *runs* (repetitions), the *inputs* required and *outputs* produced by each run, as well as the *runner* system that carries the execution. In addition to that, each experiment defines its own global environment configuration through a value of type *Config* (discussed in more detail in the next section).

### System

The second important class in the model is *System*. It has a *name*, a *version*, and a *lifespan* value (one of *Provided*, *Suite*, *Experiment*, or* Run*) which indicates when to start and stop the system when executing a suite of experiments. In addition to that, a system also maintains a list of system dependencies.

### Experiment Suite

A series of related experiments can be organized in an *ExperimentSuite*. A typical relation between the members of a suite is varying a certain configuration or application parameter, e.g., the number of hosts for a scale-out experiment, or the predicate literal for a select query with varying selectivity.

### Data Sets

Experiments typically depend on some kind of input data, represented as abstract DataSet elements associated with a particular FileSystem in our model. The following types are currently supported:

* *CopiedDataSet* - used for static data copied into the target *FileSystem*;
* *GeneratedDataSet* - used for data generated by a Job into the target *FileSystem*;

## Dependency Graph

An experiment suite induces a dependency graph based on the following rules:

* An *ExperimentSuite* depends on its experiments;
* An *Experiment* depends on its *runner* and its *inputs*;
* A *DataSet* depends on its *FileSystem*;
* A *System* depends on its *dependencies*.

This dependency graph is used to determine which systems need to be running at various points in the lifecycle of an experiment.
