Create the blog posts in the directory "_posts". The posts are ordered by date, so keep in mind to set a "date" property in the 
format `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` in the header of the file. The name of the file has to be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd-[title].[md|html|markdown]`. 
The `title` part can have hyphens inside.
